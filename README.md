# Project Description

NeuroGen is a blog that provides the user with brain enhancement tools and information about neuroscience and nootropics. With the current advances in neuroscience and science in general, the concept of self-optimization is becoming more accessible to everyday people. The purpose of NeuroGen is to bridge the gap that exists between the lab and the home, providing easy-to-digest biohacking knowledge to the public.
